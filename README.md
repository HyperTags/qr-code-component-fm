## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add a custom self-hosted font to my website using @fontface. The syntax is like this;

````css
    @font-face {
      font-family: OutfitBold;
      src: url("font/Outfit-Bold.ttf")format("truetype");
      font-weight: 700;
      font-style: normal;
      font-display: swap;
    }
````

### Continued development

- [Media Queries] - I encountered challenges working with media queries to make the website responsible. I seek to perfect it before the next challenge.

- [Flexbox] - I was cool with flexbox but I want to continue and perfect myself in using it.

### Useful resources

- [How to Center ANYTHING in CSS](https://www.youtube.com/elite-tech-club) - This helped me with positioning the card at the center of the viewport. I really liked the explanation and the various other ways to centering items it provided and will use it going forward.
- [How to Import New Fonts in HTML and CSS (Local Fonts & Google Fonts)](https://www.youtube.com/code-&-deploy) - This video helped me with adding the Outfit font to my project. It was very helpful.
- [Media Query in CSS [Easiest Way] How To Write Media Queries](https://www.youtube.com/code-bless-you) - This video helped me with writing media query to make the website responsive.
